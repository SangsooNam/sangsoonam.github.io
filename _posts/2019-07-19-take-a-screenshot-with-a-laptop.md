title: "Adb: Take a Screenshot with a Laptop"
---

When you use an Android emulator, taking a screenshot is quite easy. Just press the 'Take screenshot' on the sidebar or press the shortcut (For Mac, `âŒ˜` + `S`). However, it is slightly cumbersome if you want to take a screenshot from your device and store that in your laptop. The reason is that you need to pull a screenshot file after taking a screenshot in the device.

When the device is connected to your laptop, you can do it with `adb` commands: `shell` and `pull`. The first command takes a screenshot and store into your device. The second command pulls it to your laptop from the Android device. Although it works, it makes a bit unnecessary intermediate file in your device, which is `screenshot.png`.


{% highlight shell %}
$ adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screenshot.png
$ adb pull /sdcard/screenshot.png
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to an intermediate file, this requires two commands. This is not a big deal but you may want to find a simpler way. If you are looking for it, below command is it. This command takes a screenshot from the connected device and stores it on your laptop.

{% highlight shell%}
$ adb exec-out screencap -p > screenshot.png
{% endhighlight %}

This command saves a screenshot to `screenshot.png`. As you notice, this will overwrite an existing file when you run multiple times. You probably don't want to do. When you click 'Take screenshot' on Android emulator, it uses a naming convention, `Screenshot_{unix_timestamp}.png`. To do the same behavior, you can utilize `date` command.

{% highlight shell%}
$ adb exec-out screencap -p > `date +Screenshot_%s.png`
{% endhighlight %}

> If you run this frequently, you can set an alias for that.

<p class="code-label">.zshrc</p>
{% highlight shell%}
alias asc='adb exec-out screencap -p > `date +Screenshot_%s.png`'
{% endhighlight %}


This command is enough for most cases. However, there is still some chance to overwrite because `unix_timestamp` uses seconds. If you concern that, you can add a millisecond additionally. `%N` returns nanoseconds and `%3N` returns milliseconds by cutting the first 3 digits.

{% highlight shell%}
$ adb exec-out screencap -p > `date +Screenshot_%s.%3N.png`
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, `date` command in the mac doesn't support `%N`. So, you can't get milliseconds. If you have this issue, use `gdate`(GNU date) command.

{% highlight shell%}
$ brew install coreutils
$ adb exec-out screencap -p > `gdate +Screenshot_%s.%3N.png`
{% endhighlight %}

> `brew install coreutils` installs `gdate` on Mac.
